🐘 carthage
============

carthage uses the [cosmopolitan libc][cosmo] to build [αcτµαlly pδrταblε][ape] PHP executables.

We offer two flavors:

 - The latest official [PHP][php], compiled barebones (`--disable-all`) **~13MB ape**
 - The embedded [PH7][PH7] engine. **~2MB ape**

Please note that _BOTH BUILDS ARE EXPERIMENTAL_.

### Building Locally

You'll need wget, unzip and make. Then:

```
sh carthage.sh
```

### Binary Releases

Releases are unavailable for now. 

You can grab leftover binaries from our [build](https://github.com/alganet/carthage/actions) artifacts if you want to test them. Click any successful build and scroll down for the archive.
